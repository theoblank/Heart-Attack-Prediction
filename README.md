# Heart-Attack-Prediction
This repository contains the data and notebooks in order to predict the likelihood of a heart attack.

The dataset is not mine and the proper references will be stated at the end of this file.

The notebook contains the data analysis in which I conducted. Using a decision tree classifier to train and test the data, I then saw how accurately it can predict someone having a higher likelihood of having a heart attack.
